      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker is a cutting-edge containerization platform that runs applications with isolated containers that include part of software into a complete file system that provides necessaries for software operation (source: http://opensourceforu.com/2017/02/docker-favourite-devops-world/). It is developed by Docker, Inc. and was first released in 2013 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)). Compared to VMware that runs Virtual Machines on single server hardware (at bare metal level), Docker virtualizes things on single Operating System (at OS level). Therefore, tasks like hardware management, resource management, and capacity planning can be dropped with Docker as the software container platform (source: https://kerneltalks.com/virtualization/what-is-docker-introduction-guide-to-docker/). Below figure indicates the differences between Virtual Machines and Docker Containers (source: Docker).</p>

      <h2>What is Nginx</h2>
      <p>Nginx is a free open-source software created for stable and high-performance web serving. It can also be used in reverse proxying & load balancing for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers, mail proxying (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP), and more. Asides its high performance and stability, Nginx is also known for its rich feature set, simple configuration, and low resource consumption. Unlike the traditional servers, the more scalable asynchronous architecture used by Nginx makes it independent of threads to handle requests and makes it one of the few servers written to address the C10K problem (source: Nginx). Nginx was released in 2004 and is created by Igor Sysoev (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx). Some high-profile companies using NGINX include Microsoft, IBM, Google, Adobe, VMWare, Cisco, Facebook, Twitter, Apple, and Intel (source: https://siftery.com/company/nginx).</p>

      <h2>What is VM (virtual machine)</h2>
      <p>Virtual machine (VM) simulates actual computers and it is a computer file (called an image). It performs as a sandboxed from the rest of the system, so its contents wonâ€™t tamper with the computer and this property makes VM an ideal environment for testing other operating systems such as to access data infected with virus. On a single physical computer, multiple virtual machines can run simultaneously and each of them provides its own virtual hardware, including CPUs, memory, hard drives, network interfaces, and other devices. The virtual hardware is mapped to the real hardware on the physical machine which saves costs by reducing the need for physical hardware systems along with the associated maintenance costs that go with it, plus reduces power and cooling demand (source: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-a-virtual-machine/). Some different kinds of virtual machines include system virtual machines (also called full virtualization VMs) that provide the functionality needed to execute entire operating systems and process virtual machines that are used to execute computer programs in a platform-independent environment (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine).</p>

      <h2>Who is Cloud Computing Service Provider - Digitalocean</h2>
      <p>DigitalOcean is a cloud platform that provides developers with fast and efficient deploy, manage, and scale cloud applications (source: DigitalOcean). It is provided by DigitalOcean, Inc., an American cloud infrastructure provider with data centers around the world (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigitalOcean).</p>
